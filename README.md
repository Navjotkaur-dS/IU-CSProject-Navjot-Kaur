# Predictive Train Delay and Disruption Analysis System (Deutsche Bahn)

# Problem Statement:
Passengers on Deutsche Bahn often face irregular train delays and disruptions because of variety of factors such as weather conditions,track maintenance,platform congestion ,vehicle change and peak hour traffic.Most of the information provided by the available systems is reactive and discriptive. It means that passengers are informed about the delays afterwords rather than before delays happen.This kind of reactive information or strategy effects planning of both passengers and train operators and that result in irritation,missing connection and poor resource management.Decision makers find it difficult to take measures to prevent them because current tools are not providing precise information abbout why disruptions occur.

# Goal:
1. Predict Train delays and disruptions before they occur using historical and real-time data.
2. Give accurate projection of the delay times, various routes and time periods.
3. Determine the main causes of train delays such as bad weather and traffic.
4. Use predictive data to help operators in making better operational choices.
5. Enhace the passengers experience by providing reliable travel information and alerts about delays.
6. Provide simple display for showing train status and prediction results.
7. Create and understandable ,Modular AI system that allows continuous learning and development.

# Tech Stack:
1. Frontend: react.js, plotly.js (for showing real time results)
2. Backend API: FastAPI, Flask (for predictions and explanations)
3. Database: PostgreSQL (Store structured and prediction data)
4. AI Engine: Scikit-learn, XGBoost, SHAP (fpr predicting delay and disruptions)
5. Data Ingestion: Python, Airflow, APIs (for collecting and cleaning live and historical data)
6. Integration: REST APIs, WebSockets (for Connecting components)
7. Data Sources: Deutsche Bahn open data API, OpenWeatherMap API, Calender/Holiday API

# Phase Status
1. Conception Phase - Done
2. Development Phase - under progress
